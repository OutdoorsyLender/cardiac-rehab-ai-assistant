This is normal. Just keep in mind, now is the ideal time to change the way you live. This way, you can feel more secure about the future. More importantly, you can live a healthier life. This workbook helps you get started.",
	"What Is Heart Disease?": "Heart disease refers to any condition that makes it difficult for the heart to do its job. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common type of heart disease. It occurs when arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle become narrowed. When the arteries get too narrowed, a heart attack can result.",
	"What Is Cardiac Rehabilitation?": "Cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) is a program that helps you improve your heart health by changing your lifestyle. The program is run by a team of medical professionals who are specially trained to treat people with heart disease. You'll be taught skills to manage heart disease, both now and in the future. Cardiac rehab often takes place in a group setting, which means you'll have help and support from others. Sometimes, the program is home-based. In such cases, a healthcare provider will offer guidance.",
	"How This Workbook Helps": "Cardiac rehab can aid your recovery. It will teach you skills to reduce your risk of future problems related to your heart health. This workbook will help you put those skills to good use. By supporting what you learn in the program, the workbook will help you:\n- Understand the factors that put you at risk of another heart problem.\n- Learn ways to manage and reduce your heart disease risks.\n- Track changes in your risk factors over time.\n- Set and meet realistic goals.\n- Know when to contact your healthcare provider about a problem.",
	"How the Heart Works": "The heart is a muscle that pumps blood throughout the body. Like other muscles, the heart needs a steady supply of oxygen to function. Blood carries oxygen to the heart and the rest of the body through blood vessels called arteries. In the heart, the coronary arteries supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. If the heart doesn't get enough oxygen, angina or a heart attack can result.\n\nWhat Is Ejection Fraction?\nEjection Fraction (EF) is a measure of the blood that the heart pumps out. This typically refers to how much of the total blood in the left ventricle is pumped out with each beat. A normal EF is between 0.55 and 0.70.\n\nThe left main coronary artery divides into two branches, described below.\n- The circumflex coronary artery supplies blood to the back and left side of the heart.\n- The right coronary artery supplies blood to the right side and bottom of the heart.\n- The left anterior descending coronary artery supplies blood to the front and left side of the heart.",
	"How the Heart Pumps Blood": "With each beat, the heart muscle must pump out enough blood to keep the body healthy. The right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body, and it sends it out to the lungs. The lungs add oxygen to that blood. Oxygen-rich blood then flows to the left side of the heart. The left side pumps this blood out to the rest of the body. Each heartbeat has two steps: systole and diastole. During each step, actions occur in the atria and the ventricles at the same time. The two steps repeat with each heartbeat.",
	"Valves Control the Flow": "There are four valves inside the heart. When the heart beats, valves act like one-way doors. This keeps blood moving forward through the heart's chambers and to the body.\n- The aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body.\n- The pulmonary valve.\n- The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs.\n- The tricuspid valve.\n- Lungs for oxygen.",
	"My Ejection Fraction": "Date: Ejection fraction: Test used:",
	"Understanding Arteries and Heart Disease": "Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. Arteries can become damaged by a waxy buildup called plaque. This buildup causes the arteries to stiffen and narrow (atherosclerosis) and makes it harder for blood to flow. If plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, which carry blood to the heart muscle, it can lead to CAD. But atherosclerosis is not limited to the heart. It can also happen in other arteries, such as those leading to the brain.",
	"Healthy Arteries": "Healthy arteries have flexible walls and smooth inner linings. Blood flows freely through them to deliver oxygen all over the body. The coronary arteries lie on the outside surface of the heart. Blood flows through these arteries to supply oxygen to the heart muscle. The heart muscle needs this oxygen to stay healthy and keep pumping blood throughout the body.\n- The inner lining is smooth, so blood can flow through freely.\n- The artery walls are flexible, letting more blood flow through the artery when needed.\n- Blood flows easily through the artery.",
	"Unhealthy Arteries": "If an artery's inner lining is damaged, cholesterol and other harmful lipids (fats in the blood) can collect in the artery wall. This buildup is plaque. It narrows the artery so that less blood flows through. Sometimes plaque ruptures (breaks open). A blood clot can then form and possibly block the artery. With CAD, these problems occur in the coronary arteries.\n- The inner lining is damaged, making it easier for plaque to collect.\n- Plaque collects in the artery walls. This stiffens the walls and narrows the passage where blood flows.\n- Plaque can break open, limiting blood flow even more.\n- A blood clot may form after plaque ruptures. This can block the artery and cut off blood flow.",
	"Your Heart Is at Risk": "Plaque and blood clots in the coronary arteries reduce blood flow to the heart:\n- When a coronary artery narrows, less blood and oxygen flow to the heart muscle. The decreased blood flow can cause symptoms of angina (often felt as temporary pain or pressure in or near the chest).\n- When a coronary artery narrows too much, very little blood and oxygen reach the heart muscle beyond the site of narrowing. If a clot forms, blood flow in the artery may stop. This can result in a heart attack. If the muscle goes without oxygen for too long, that part of the heart muscle dies.\n- Heart muscle beyond the blockage doesn't get enough oxygen and is damaged.",
	"Your Whole Body Is at Risk": "Plaque buildup can lead to problems throughout the body. Common sites of artery problems are discussed below.\n- The brain. Arteries in the brain or leading to the brain can become blocked. When this happens, part of the brain can't get the oxygen it needs. That portion of the brain is damaged. This is a stroke.\n- The heart. (See above, under Your Heart Is at Risk.)\n- The kidneys. If an artery that carries blood to the kidneys is narrowed, the kidneys have a hard time filtering blood. This can lead to kidney damage.\n- The aorta. This is the body's main artery. It connects directly to the heart. If this artery is damaged, the affected section can weaken and balloon out. This is called an aortic aneurysm.\n- The legs. If arteries in the legs are clogged with plaque, cramping or aching in the buttocks, thighs, or calves can occur when walking. This is called claudication.",
	"Signs of an Emergency": "There is no cure for heart disease, but it can be effectively managed, allowing patients to live long and happy lives. Cardiac rehab and other treatments will make you healthier and lower your risk of a heart attack or stroke. But an emergency could still happen. It's important to know and watch for signs of heart attack and stroke. This way you can get help as soon as possible. Family members can help watch for these signs, too.",
	"Signs of a Heart Attack": "For both men and women, many heart attacks start as pain or discomfort in the center of the chest. Women are more likely than men to have atypical symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting and back pain or fatigue. Common signs of heart attack include:\n- Chest discomfort, such as pain, aching, tightness, or pressure that lasts more than a few minutes, or that comes and goes.\n- Pain or discomfort in the stomach, one or both arms, back, shoulder, neck, or jaw.\n- Shortness of breath.\n- Sweating (often a cold, clammy sweat), nausea, lightheadedness.",
	"The Difference Between Angina and a Heart Attack": "Angina is not the same as a heart attack. Angina doesn't cause lasting damage to the heart. But it may be a sign that you're at risk of having a heart attack. If chest discomfort only lasts for a few minutes, you might be having an angina attack. Fast-acting nitroglycerin can usually stop this (see page 56). Keep this medication with you at all times. But if nitroglycerin does not relieve your discomfort within 5 minutes, call 911. You could be having a heart attack.",
	"Signs of a Stroke": "Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side.\n- Sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding.\n- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.\n- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance.\n- Sudden, severe headache with no known cause.",
	"Heed the Warning: TIA": "Many people get a warning that a stroke is coming on. This warning is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It is a temporary loss of blood flow to part of the brain. During a TIA, you experience some or all the symptoms above. While a TIA usually leaves no permanent damage, it should be taken very seriously. If you ever have symptoms of a stroke or TIA, even if they don't last, call 911 right away.\n\nIf You Think You're Having a Heart Attack or Stroke:\n- Get help right away if you have the symptoms described on these pages. In some cases, medication can stop a heart attack or stroke and even reverse some of the damage. For best results, these medications need to be used as soon as possible. If you have heart attack or stroke symptoms:\n- Call 911 or have someone else call. Do NOT try to drive yourself to the hospital.\n- Take nitroglycerin if it has been prescribed (heart attack symptoms only). See page 56 to learn more.\n- Take aspirin if your doctor directed you to do so.\n- Wait for help to arrive. Unlock your door if you can.\n- Rest in a comfortable position. Loosen tight clothing.\n- Don't panic or run around.\n- Don't ignore the signs or tell yourself they will pass.",
	"What Is Heart Failure?": "When you have heart failure (called congestive heart failure, in the past), your heart doesn't work as well as it should. This means some parts of your body don't get enough blood and oxygen. Finding out you have heart failure may be scary. But there's a lot you can do to keep heart failure under control.",
	"Symptoms of Heart Failure": "Heart failure may cause many symptoms, or only a few. Some of the most common symptoms include:\n- Shortness of breath, wheezing, or coughing when you exert yourself.\n- Weakness or tiredness after little effort.\n- Problems breathing when you're lying flat, or the need to sleep in a recliner or propped on pillows.\n- Waking up at night coughing or short of breath.\n- Rapid weight gain.\n- Swelling in the abdomen, ankles, or feet.\n- A racing or skipping heart.\n- Dizziness or fainting.",
	"Managing Your Symptoms": "To best manage heart failure, pay attention to your body and keep track of your symptoms. This is especially true of your weight, which should be checked every day. By watching for changes in your symptoms, you may be able to alert your healthcare provider to a problem before it becomes too serious. This may even reduce your risk of having to go to the hospital. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about what to do when specific symptoms occur.",
	"Weighing Yourself": "Rapid weight gain can be a sign that you are retaining water. This may mean that your treatment plan needs to be changed. To monitor your weight:\n- Weigh yourself each morning after you urinate and before you eat. Wear the same clothes or no clothes each time. Always use the same scale.\n- Write down your weight each day.\n- Call your healthcare provider if you gain more than 2 pounds in 1 day or more than 5 pounds in 1 week. If you receive other instructions for reporting weight gain, follow them as directed.",
	"When to Call Your Provider": "Call your healthcare provider if any of these problems occur:\n- Tightness or pain in your chest, arm, or jaw (Call 911!)\n- Rapid weight gain (see Weighing Yourself)\n- Symptoms worsen\n- New symptoms develop after taking medications\n- Breathing becomes more difficult, or you start coughing at night\n- Feet or ankles swell more than usual\n- Unusual fatigue\n- Dizzy spells or fainting\n- Swelling in the abdomen\n- Fast or irregular heartbeat\n- Many tests and procedures can be used to help diagnose heart disease. In some cases, they can also help treat the problem. Your healthcare provider may order tests and procedures based on your symptoms, risk factors, and health history. In this chapter, you'll learn:\n- How cardiac catheterization is done\n- About angioplasty and stenting\n- What to expect before, during, and after a procedure",
	"Cardiac Catheterization": "Cardiac catheterization (cath) is a procedure that can show the condition of coronary arteries and heart valves. It can also show how well the heart pumps and blood flows through the heart. This helps your doctor diagnose your heart problem. Cardiac cath can also be used to perform procedures that treat blocked arteries. This can relieve symptoms such as angina and help prevent serious problems like a heart attack.",
	"Preparing for Your Procedure": "Being well prepared can help you feel more at ease on the day of your procedure. Be sure to:\n- Tell your doctor what medications you take. This includes those bought over the counter and any herbs or supplements. It also includes medications to prevent blood clots. You may be asked to stop taking one or more before your procedure. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe a new medication to take.\n- Tell your doctor if you are allergic to iodine or any medications.\n- Mention if you are pregnant or think you could be pregnant.\n- Follow instructions about not eating or drinking anything before the procedure.\n- Pack a bag if there is a chance you will have to stay overnight.",
	"Before the Procedure": "Before cardiac cath begins, an IV line is put into your arm or hand to give you medications and fluids. You may be asked your name and type of procedure more than once. This is for your safety.",
	"In the Cath Lab": "Once in the cath lab, you'll lie on an X-ray table. You may be given medication to relax you and make you drowsy for the procedure:\n- Hair may be removed from the skin over the insertion site in the groin, arm, or wrist.\n- The skin is numbed. A tiny puncture or incision is made into the artery at the insertion site. A catheter is then inserted. It is threaded through blood vessels to the heart. Blood vessels have no pain receptors, so you won't feel this.\n- If you are having a right heart cath, a catheter will also be placed in a nearby vein. (Veins are vessels that return blood to the heart.)\n- During the procedures that follow, the catheter may be removed and replaced several times. This is done to reach each of the coronary arteries or heart chambers.",
	"Coronary Angiography": "Once the catheter is inside the coronary artery, angiography may be done. During this test, X-ray dye is injected through the catheter. This makes the arteries and any narrowing or blockages show up on X-rays. You may feel a warm flush as the dye reaches your bloodstream. Your doctor may ask you to hold your breath or cough. As pictures are taken, the lights may be dimmed and you may hear the noise of the camera.",
	"Planning Your Treatment": "After the angiography, the doctor will discuss the results with you. This may happen while you're still in the cath lab or after you've been moved to another room. In many cases, angioplasty and stenting can be done to improve blood flow. If your angiography shows that these are good options, they may be done right away. Or they may be scheduled for later. In some cases, depending on the number and location of blockages, the doctor may advise scheduling coronary artery bypass surgery instead.",
	"Angioplasty and Stenting": "These treatments use a catheter to clear narrowing and blockages in the artery. If angiography shows a narrowing or blockage, balloon angioplasty and stenting may be able to open the arteries. These procedures are done in the cath lab. They are often done immediately after angiography.",
	"Balloon Angioplasty": "For this procedure, the catheter is used to move a special balloon into the artery. This balloon is inflated and deflated to compress plaque and open the artery. Angioplasty is almost always followed by placement of a wire mesh tube called a stent.",
	"Stenting": "A balloon-tipped catheter is used to place the stent into the narrowed part of the artery. A stent is a tiny, flexible wire mesh tube. The stent helps keep the path of blood flow open. It is not removed. Your doctor may advise the use of a drug-eluting stent. This type of stent releases medication over time to help keep scar tissue from forming as the artery heals. This may prevent a new blockage from forming in the same place (restenosis).",
	"Recovering After a Procedure": "If you only had testing done, you may be able to leave the hospital within 2 to 8 hours. If a treatment such as stenting was performed, you may stay overnight. In either case, your doctor will determine when you can safely go home.",
	"Closing the Insertion Site": "The insertion site in the artery may be closed using a device or direct pressure. A closure device may be a plug, stitch, or clip. Direct pressure means a healthcare provider will hold pressure on the site until bleeding stops. Then a tight bandage is applied. In either case, you may need to lie still, with your leg or arm straight, for 2 to 6 hours. During this time, you may not be able to get up to use the bathroom. Staff will attend to you, though, and help keep you comfortable.",
	"Monitoring Your Condition": "Tubes and machines help monitor your health. These will be removed as you become stable. You may have:\n- A line in your wrist or neck to monitor blood pressure or other pressures in your heart\n- An IV to provide medications and fluids\n- Tubes to drain fluid from your chest\n- A catheter to drain urine\n- Temporary pacing wires in your heart to help regulate your heartbeat\n- An intra-aortic balloon pump to take over some of the heart's pumping function (if needed). This lets the heart relax and recover. You'll likely be sedated until this is removed.",
	"Going Home": "Expect to stay in the hospital for about 4 to 7 days. In some cases, you may go to a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility until you are ready to go home. Before you are discharged, you'll meet with a doctor or nurse to discuss the next steps of your recovery. You'll be given instructions about medications, diet, and activity. Be sure to ask any questions you have. Have someone ready to help you for the first week or two after surgery.",
	"At Home": "You can go back to your normal routine soon after the procedure. As you recover:\n- Follow activity guidelines you are given. These include restrictions on lifting and strenuous activities. Talk to your doctor about when you can resume having sex.\n- Take medications as directed by your doctor. This is crucial to the success of the procedure.\n- If you had a groin incision, avoid tub baths for a few days. Shower or take sponge baths instead.\n- Ask your doctor when you can start driving again. Also ask when you can go back to work.\n- Talk with your doctor about a plan for getting regular exercise.",
	"When to Call Your Doctor": "Once at home, call your doctor right away if you have any of these signs or symptoms:\n- Fever of 100°F (37.7°C) or higher\n- Swelling, redness, or cloudy discharge at the incision sites\n- Chest pain or trouble breathing\n- Fast, slow, or skipping heartbeats (palpitations)\n- Leg pain or swelling\n- Dizziness or fainting\n- Sudden weight gain (2 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 1 week)\n- Pain that isn't controlled with medications\n- Clicking sounds or grinding in your breastbone",
	"Implantable Devices": "If there is a problem with your heart's electrical system, your provider may recommend an implantable device. An implantable device is a small electronic device that is placed permanently inside your body. The devices explained in this chapter are:\n- A pacemaker. This will protect your heart if it beats too slowly.\n- An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This will protect your heart if it beats too fast or irregularly. It can also correct a slow heart rhythm.\n- A left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) device. This will help decrease your stroke risk if you have atrial fibrillation (AFib).",
	"The Heart's Electrical System": "The heart is a muscle that pumps blood throughout the body. The heart's electrical system tells it when to contract (squeeze). If there's a problem with this electrical system, the heart may not beat as often as it should. This means that the heart can't pump the amount of blood that the body needs.",
	"Signals Tell the Heart to Beat": "Each heartbeat starts with an electrical signal. The signals are sent and received by special electrical cells in the heart called nodes. As the signals move through the heart, they tell the chambers that pump blood (called atria and ventricles) when to contract. With physical activity, the signals from the nodes speed up to pump blood faster. During rest, the signals return to a normal speed.\n- The SA (sinoatrial, or sinus) node is the heart's natural pacemaker. It starts each heartbeat by sending an electrical signal that tells the atria to contract.\n- The atria are the upper chambers where blood enters the heart. When the atria contract, blood is sent to the ventricles.\n- The AV (atrioventricular) node receives the signal from the SA node after it passes through the atria. It then guides the signal to the ventricles.\n- The bundle branches are pathways of cells that carry the signal through the ventricles. As the signal moves through the ventricles, they contract.\n- The ventricles are the heart's lower chambers. They contract to pump blood out of the heart.",
	"Problems with Electrical Signals": "A slow heartbeat is often due to problems with the SA node or AV node. The heartbeat may be slow only once in a while or all the time. In some cases, the heartbeat doesn't speed up during physical activity.\n\nSick Sinus Syndrome\nThe main problem that affects the SA node is called sick sinus syndrome. It can cause:\n- Sinus bradycardia. The SA node sends out signals too slowly.\n- Sinus pause. The SA node fails to create a signal. Without a signal, the atria don't contract.\n- Tachy-brady syndrome is a type of sick sinus syndrome. The heartbeat switches between very fast and too slow.\n\nAV Block ('Heart Block')\nHeart block occurs when the AV node has problems passing on electrical signals from the SA node to the ventricles. It can be caused by problems with either the AV node or the bundle branches. If the ventricles don't receive a signal, they don't contract. This may happen only once in a while. Or the signal may be blocked all the time.",
	"Atrial Fibrillation": "An arrhythmia is any problem with the speed or pattern of the heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common type of arrhythmia. It causes fast, chaotic electrical signals in the atria. This makes it hard for the heart to work as it should. It also affects how much blood your heart can pump out to the body. Abnormal signals in the right atrium.",
	"How a Pacemaker Works": "A pacemaker contains a tiny computer. It tracks the speed of the heartbeat. If the heart beats too slowly, it sends electrical signals to the heart. These signals 'pace' the heart to keep the heartbeat at a minimum speed. Sensors in the pacemaker also keep track of the body's activity level and can adjust the signals as needed.",
	"The Parts of a Pacemaker": "The pacemaker is shown at about actual size.\n- The connector (header) is the part of the generator where the lead or leads are attached.\n- The generator sends out electrical signals. It has a smooth, lightweight case that contains a tiny computer and battery. It is placed between your skin and chest muscle.\n- Leads are wires covered by soft, flexible material. They are placed in a vein that goes to your heart. This lets them carry the generator's signals directly to the heart. Sensors on the leads also help the generator keep track of your heart's rhythm.\n- Anchors on the tips of the leads attach the leads to the heart muscle.",
	"Types of Pacemakers": "You and your doctor will discuss the type of pacemaker that's best for you. Most pacemakers have one or two leads. If you have a condition called heart failure, you may be given a pacemaker with three leads instead.\n- A single-chamber pacemaker has one lead. The lead is usually put into the right ventricle. The exact placement inside the ventricle may vary.\n- A dual-chamber pacemaker has two leads. One is in the right atrium. The other is in the right ventricle. Having two leads helps coordinate the signals that tell these chambers when to contract.",
	"How a Pacemaker Adapts to Your Needs": "When you're active, your heart beats faster to meet the body's need for more blood and oxygen. Problems with the heart's electrical system can prevent the heart from beating faster. To address this problem, all pacemakers have a rate-responsive feature. This means they can adjust your heart rate as needed. The pacemaker automatically speeds up when you're active. It returns to a normal speed when you're resting.",
	"How an ICD Works": "An ICD can sense when your heart rhythm becomes dangerously fast. Depending on the type of abnormal rhythm, the ICD will either send electrical impulses to override the fast rhythm and bring it back to normal, or it will interrupt the fast rhythm by briefly shocking the heart. After this shock, the heart rhythm usually returns to normal. ICDs have different capabilities. Your doctor will choose the type of ICD that's best for you and your heart.",
	"The Parts of an ICD": "This is an ICD shown close to the average size. Actual ICD sizes may vary.\n- The generator is a smooth, lightweight metal case that holds a tiny computer and a battery. The generator keeps track of your heart rhythm. If an abnormal rhythm occurs, it sends out either electrical impulses or a shock.\n- The leads are wires covered by flexible plastic. These carry information about the heart rhythm to the generator. They also carry electrical impulses or a shock to the heart when needed. All ICDs have at least 1 lead, which goes into the right ventricle. Some ICDs have 1 or 2 more leads going into other chambers.",
	"What an ICD Does": "An ICD can do one or more of the following:\n- Antitachycardia pacing (ATP): When ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs, the ICD sends out a series of impulses. These may make the rhythm return to normal. ATP may feel like fluttering in your chest, or may not be felt at all.\n- Cardioversion: In some cases, ATP can't correct VT as described above. When this happens, the ICD gives the heart one or more small shocks. These stop the fast rhythm for a moment. When the heart rhythm resumes, it usually goes back to normal.\n- Defibrillation: If the ICD senses ventricular fibrillation (VF), it quickly sends a strong shock to the heart. This stops the heart for a second, giving it a chance to go back to a normal rhythm.\n- Bradycardia pacing: An ICD's main job is to slow a fast heart rhythm. At times, though, your heart might beat too slowly. The ICD can help by sending out pacing impulses. These get the slow heartbeat back to the right speed.\n- An ICD is usually implanted under the skin in the chest, just below the collarbone.",
	"If You Have Heart Failure": "With heart failure (a weakened heart muscle), the ventricles' contractions may not be coordinated (timed correctly). If you have heart failure and are also at risk of developing a life-threatening heart rhythm, a special type of ICD may be used to treat both problems. This ICD has leads in both ventricles (unlike a standard ICD, which has a lead in only the right ventricle). The ICD senses and corrects the timing of the ventricles' beats. This treatment is called cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or biventricular pacing. This ICD also treats fast heart rhythms, just like a regular ICD.",
	"How the Device Is Put into the Body": "The device is usually implanted in the chest on the opposite side of your dominant hand. Implantation does not require open heart surgery (your chest will not be opened). During implantation:\n- An incision is made in the skin below the collarbone. This creates a 'pocket' to hold the ICD.\n- A lead is threaded through the incision into a vein in the upper chest. With the help of X-ray monitors, the lead is then guided into one of the heart's chambers. Depending on how many leads your ICD has, this process may be repeated to guide leads into other chambers.\n- The leads are attached to the heart muscle so they will stay in place.\n- The generator is attached to the leads. Then, the generator is placed in its pocket under the skin.\n- A fast heart rhythm may be induced (started) to test the ICD.\n- When everything else is done, the incision is closed with sutures, medical glue, or staples.",
	"Other Implantation Sites": "In some cases, the ICD can be put elsewhere in the body. This could be in the abdomen, on the right side of the chest, or on the left side under the muscle. If one of these is an option for you, your doctor will explain more.",
	"Risks and Complications": "The risks of ICD implantation are very low. Some of the risks include:\n- Bleeding, bruising, or severe swelling at the incision site\n- Infection of the incision\n- Puncture and partial collapse of the lung\n- Irregular heartbeat\n- Damage to nerves, blood vessels, or heart muscle requiring surgery or blood transfusions\n- Heart attack, stroke, or death (very rare)",
	"What Is Atrial Fibrillation?": "An arrhythmia is a problem with the speed or pattern of the heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common type of arrhythmia. It causes irregular electrical signals in the atria, the upper chambers in the heart. This makes it hard for the heart to work as well as it should. It also increases the risk for blood clots in the heart, which can cause a stroke. Most of these blood clots form in an area called the left atrial appendage (LAA).",
	"What Is an LAAO Device?": "A left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) device is a type of implantable device. It is placed in the LAA (left atrial appendage) and over about 45 days a seal forms to cover the device and appendage. By sealing off the appendage, blood will not be able to flow into the LAA, thus decreasing your stroke risk. LAAOs come in several shapes but are all about the size of a quarter.",
	"How Is an LAAO Device Put into the Body?": "To implant the LAAO, your surgeon will put a long tube (catheter) into a vein near your groin. Once it is in the right place, the device opens, like an umbrella.",
	"What Happens After the Device Is Implanted?": "You will stay in the hospital overnight. For the first 45 days after the procedure, you will take a blood-thinning medicine. If you cannot take it, your doctor may prescribe another medicine. You will have a transesophageal echo (TEE), a heart ultrasound, about 45 days after your procedure. At this time, your doctor may tell you to stop taking the blood thinner and give you an antiplatelet medicine. You will also take aspirin. After 6 months, you will stop taking the blood thinner and take only aspirin. You will be able to walk through metal detectors without setting them off. Before having an MRI, be sure to tell your doctor you have an LAAO. You may be able to have some types of MRIs under certain conditions.",
	"After the Procedure": "You'll stay in the hospital at least overnight. Before you go home, you'll be given discharge instructions. These will describe how to care for your incision and any special precautions you must take. If you have questions, ask your doctor or nurse. As you recover, you'll have follow-up visits to check your incision and pacemaker, ICD, or LAAO device.",
	"In the Hospital": "Your heart will be monitored to see how the device is working. You will also be watched for signs of infection or side effects of the medications used during the procedure. While in the hospital, tell your nurse if you notice any chest pain, shortness of breath, twitching, or hiccups.",
	"Recovering at Home": "Follow your healthcare provider's directions for home recovery. It may take several weeks to get back to normal activity. Using the groin artery is the least invasive method and heals the fastest. During your recovery:\n- Take medicine as directed. Take pain medicine, blood thinners, and any other medicine exactly as your healthcare provider advises. You will likely need to take aspirin and another blood thinner (antiplatelets) for a period. You'll need to take the aspirin for the rest of your life.\n- Take care of your incision. It's normal for your incision to be bruised, itchy, or sore while it's healing. Your incision may take a week or more to heal. Care for the bandage and incision as advised. Wash it every day with warm water and soap. Gently pat it dry. Don't put powder, lotion, or ointment on the incision until it's healed.\n- Shower carefully. Unless you're told otherwise, you can shower once you get home. Use warm water and a mild soap. Avoid hot water because it can make you feel lightheaded. Don't take a bath until your healthcare provider says it's okay. Also, don't sit in a swimming pool or hot tub until your doctor says it's okay. Your doctor may tell you to avoid strenuous activities for a week or more. This includes no heavy lifting. Instructions on what to do are different depending on how your surgery was done. Your doctor will give you specific instructions that are appropriate for you.\n- Don't drive if you are taking opioid pain medicine. These medicines can make you feel sleepy, and it is unsafe to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking them.\n- Walk daily. One of the best ways to get stronger is to walk. If your doctor agrees, start with short walks at home. Walk a little more each day. Take someone with you until you feel ready to walk alone.",
	"Taking Care of Your Incision": "Your discharge instructions will tell you how to care for your incision. Change the dressing once a day, or as often as instructed. Avoid getting the incision wet until your healthcare provider says it's okay. You may be told to take sponge baths for the first few days. Don't scrub the incision. And don't use lotion, ointment, or powder on the incision while it heals.",
	"Follow-Up Visits": "See your heart doctor and primary care doctor as often as recommended. Here are some follow-up visits you may have:\n- About 1 to 2 weeks after implantation, you'll see your healthcare provider to make sure the incision is healing well.\n- Within a few months after implantation, your healthcare provider will check your device to make sure it's working the best for your heart. You'll continue to have these visits as long as your device is in place.",
	"When to Call Your Healthcare Team": "Call if you have any of these after the procedure:\n- Signs of an infection, such as: fever over 100°F (37.7°C); drainage from the incision; redness, swelling, or warmth at the incision site\n- Twitching chest muscles\n- Pain around your ICD that gets worse, not better\n- Bleeding from your incision\n- Swelling in the arm on the side of the incision site\n- Severe swelling of the incision site (bulging up like a golf ball)\n- Chest pain or shortness of breath",
	"Heart Surgery": "Your doctor may recommend surgery for your heart problem. The surgeries explained in this chapter will improve your blood flow and reduce the chances of other heart problems, such as heart attack and heart failure. In this chapter, you'll learn:\n- How coronary artery bypass surgery and heart valve surgery are done.\n- What to expect before, during, and after heart surgery.",
	"How Bypass Surgery Is Done": "During bypass surgery, blockages are not removed. Rather, a new pathway is created around the blocked part of a coronary artery. This is done using a healthy blood vessel taken from elsewhere in the body. Called a bypass graft, this vessel is attached to the coronary artery beyond the blockage. This way, blood flows through the graft and bypasses the blocked part of the artery.",
	"Preparing the Bypass Graft": "The blood vessel used for the bypass graft may be taken from the chest, leg, or arm. This usually doesn't affect blood flow in that body part. If you have more than one blockage, more than one graft may be needed. These blood vessels are used most often:\n- The internal thoracic arteries, located in the chest wall\n- The saphenous vein, located in the leg\n- The radial artery, located in the arm",
	"Reaching the Heart": "While one member of the bypass team is getting the graft, another member works to reach your heart. First, an incision is made in the chest. Then the breastbone is divided. The breastbone is held open throughout surgery. This puts pressure on the nerves of the chest. Because of this, you may have soreness and muscle spasms in your chest, shoulders, and back, as well as numbness in your hand during recovery.",
	"Using the Heart-Lung Machine": "In some cases, a machine does the work of your heart and lungs during surgery. Blood is circulated through this heart-lung machine. The machine supplies the blood with oxygen and pumps it back through the body. This is known as an 'on-pump' procedure. In these cases, the heart may be stopped temporarily before the graft is attached. Your own heart and lungs take over after the bypass is completed. In other cases, the heart-lung machine is not used and the heart is not stopped. This is known as an 'off-pump' or 'beating heart' procedure.",
	"Attaching the Graft": "Once the graft is prepared, it is then sewn into place. There are a number of ways this can be done. Often, one end of the graft is attached to the aorta, while the other end is attached to the artery below the blockage. You and your doctor will discuss the blood vessel used for your graft and where it will be attached.",
	"Finishing Up": "Once the graft has been attached, blood will start flowing through this new pathway to bypass the blockage. If needed, more than one bypass may be done. Then the breastbone is rejoined with stainless steel wires. These stay in the chest permanently. The skin incision is closed with stitches or staples. Once the graft is attached, blood can flow around the blockage.",
	"How Heart Valves Work": "Your heart is a pump that keeps your body supplied with oxygen-rich blood. The right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and sends it out to the lungs. The lungs add oxygen to that blood. The newly oxygenated blood then flows into the left side of the heart. The left side pumps it out to the rest of the body.",
	"Healthy Heart Valves": "The heart has four chambers. Two are called atria, and two are called ventricles. As blood travels through the heart, it fills each chamber. It then exits each chamber through a one-way gate called a valve. Each valve has flaps called leaflets. They spread open to let blood out of the chamber, and then close to keep any of that blood from leaking back in. This action keeps blood flowing in the right direction. A healthy valve opens fully so blood flows out of the chamber. A healthy valve closes tightly so blood cannot flow backward.",
	"Problem Heart Valves": "A problem valve may not open wide enough, not close tightly enough, or both. In any case, not enough blood gets sent out to the body. The heart tries to make up for that shortage by working harder. But this helps only for a while. Over time, the extra work damages the heart. This can lead to heart failure. With this condition, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n- With stenosis, a valve doesn't open all the way so not enough blood gets through.\n- With regurgitation, a valve doesn't close all the way so some blood leaks backward.",
	"Problems Opening": "When a valve doesn't open all the way, the problem is called stenosis. The leaflets may be stuck together or be too stiff to open fully. When the valve doesn't open fully, the heart muscle has to work harder to push the blood through the smaller opening.",
	"Problems Closing": "When a valve doesn't close tightly enough, the problem is called regurgitation or insufficiency. The valve itself may be described as 'leaky.' The leaflets may fit together poorly. Or the structures that support the leaflets may be torn. As a result, some blood leaks through the valve back into the chamber it just left. The heart then has to move that blood again.",
	"Your Surgery": "The surgeon first gains access to the heart. Then the problem valve is either repaired or replaced. Depending on the approach used, your heart may need to be stopped for the surgery. In this case, a heart-lung machine is used. It ensures that your body continues to receive blood and oxygen throughout the procedure. The entire surgery typically takes about 4 to 6 hours.",
	"Reaching Your Heart": "Your surgeon will use one of the approaches below to reach your heart. The exact approach to be used will depend on many factors. These include your age, health history, and the nature of your valve problem.\n- Traditional sternotomy. An incision is made down the center of the chest. The breastbone (sternum) is divided to expose the heart. After surgery, the breastbone is rejoined with wires. The incision is closed.\n- Limited access (minimally invasive) surgery. One or more small incisions are made in the chest or side. The breastbone may be partially divided. The surgeon may use special instruments, such as a thin tube with a camera attached, to help during the surgery. A robotic system is sometimes used as well. After surgery, the breastbone is rejoined with wires, if needed, and the incisions are closed.",
	"Treating Valves": "The problem valve will be treated using one of the methods shown. You and your surgeon will discuss this method before the surgery. However, a different method is sometimes chosen once surgery has begun.",
	"Repair of the Valve": "Whenever they can, surgeons prefer to repair a valve rather than replace it. The most common kind of repair involves sewing a ring around the entrance to a valve to improve its size or shape. Another type of repair involves cutting tissue to allow leaflets to open or close more easily. When repair is not possible, the valve will be replaced.",
	"Replacement with a Mechanical Valve": "Mechanical valves are made of metal or hard carbon. There are many designs. They can last for decades. But blood tends to stick to them, forming clots. So if you receive a mechanical valve, you will have to take warfarin, an anticoagulant medication. This medication will be needed for the rest of your life to help prevent blood clots.",
	"Replacement with a Tissue Valve": "A tissue valve usually comes from a pig or a cow. Blood does not clot easily on tissue valves. So patients getting tissue valves may need warfarin for only a short time. Aspirin is sometimes used instead. Tissue valves may not last as long as mechanical valves.",
	"Bacterial Endocarditis": "Infective endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart (endocardium) or the valves of the heart. With infective endocarditis, your heart valves may not work well. Because of this, your heart works harder to supply blood to your body. The infection is most often from some type of bacteria, but other germs can also cause it. It's more common in men over age 60 with heart problems, especially after heart valve surgery. See your doctor if you have any of the following:\n- Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, night sweats, tiredness, muscle and joint aches, and headache\n- Trouble breathing\n- Cough\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Skin changes, such as paleness and sores on the fingers or toes\n- Tiny red spots on the skin, under the fingernails, in the whites of the eyes, and inside the mouth\n- Blood in the urine\n- Swelling of the feet, legs, or belly (abdomen)",
	"After Your Surgery": "You'll be taken to the ICU (intensive care unit) after surgery. When you wake up, it is common to feel thirsty, groggy, and cold. Nurses will help make you comfortable. They will assist you as you begin recovery.",
	"Helping You Breathe": "At first, a tube will help you breathe. It is put through your mouth and into your throat. You won't be able to talk with the breathing tube in. Nurses will ask simple questions so you can respond by nodding or shaking your head. The tube may make your throat sore. There may also be a tube in your nose or mouth, which keeps your stomach empty. As soon as you can breathe on your own, these tubes will be removed. Then you'll likely receive oxygen through a mask or small prongs in your nose.",
	"Managing Pain": "You may be given IV or oral medication for pain. Or you may have a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) machine. This machine lets you push a button to give yourself a measured dose of pain medication. Be honest about how much pain you feel. Ask for pain medication when you need it. Also, tell your nurse if the medications don't control pain or if you feel worse.",
	"Reducing Swelling": "Your legs may be swollen after surgery, especially if leg veins were taken for grafts. Raising the foot of the bed can help reduce swelling. You may also be taught to do exercises in bed.",
	"Ankle Exercise": "Start with your toes pointed. Flex your foot at the ankle and count to 5. Then relax. Repeat 10 times with each foot.",
	"Preventing Lung Problems": "After the breathing tube has been removed, you will be taught to do deep breathing and coughing exercises. These help prevent pneumonia. Your healing breastbone incision may make the exercises painful. But it is very important to do them. You may also be taught to use an incentive spirometer. This tool helps you breathe deeply.",
	"Getting Out of Bed": "A nurse or physical therapist will help you get out of bed. This will happen even before you leave the ICU. Moving around improves circulation and helps prevent blood clots, bed sores, and pneumonia. At first, you will be helped to sit. When you're well enough, you will be helped to get up and walk. Being active soon after surgery helps move your recovery along.",
	"Easing Back into Daily Activities": "Once you're home, you'll gain a little more energy and strength each day. Start off easy with activities. Do more as you feel able.",
	"As Your Breastbone Heals": "If your breastbone was cut during surgery, it typically takes weeks or longer to heal. During this time, you'll need to avoid activities that put strain on your chest. These include driving, lifting, pushing, or pulling. Your doctor will let you know when it's okay to return to your usual activities.",
	"Caring for Incisions": "It's normal for incisions to be bruised, itchy, numb, or sore for a few weeks. Wash them gently with warm water and soap, and pat dry. Don't put skin lotions or ointments on your incisions.",
	"Monitoring Yourself": "To make sure that you're recovering well, you may be asked to monitor yourself at home. This includes weighing yourself daily and writing down your weight. This also includes taking your pulse, blood pressure, and temperature, and tracking the numbers. Your doctor will discuss these records with you during your first follow-up visits.",
	"Getting Back to Your Routine": "Once at home, do only as much as you comfortably can. Time frames will vary. Here are some general guidelines:\n- Showering. Unless told not to, you can shower once you get home. Have someone nearby in case you need help. Don't take a bath until your doctor says it's okay.\n- Daily activities. Within a few days, you can return to light activities, such as cooking. Don't do anything strenuous, such as mowing the lawn or vacuuming, for at least 6 weeks.\n- Driving. Don't drive until your doctor says you can. This will likely be around 4 to 8 weeks after surgery.\n- Work. Depending on your job, you may return to work 3 to 12 weeks after surgery.\n- Sex. You may be told to avoid sex for 4 to 6 weeks. When you do have sex, use positions that don't strain your breastbone. Talk to your doctor if you're concerned.",
	"Catheter-Based Valve Repair": "Your surgeon may recommend that you have a catheter-based procedure to repair or replace your valve. These minimally invasive procedures are recommended as an alternative to open heart surgery.",
	"Understanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)": "Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a procedure to replace a diseased aortic valve with an artificial one. The old heart valve is not removed. Instead, it is left in place to act as an anchor for the new valve. This procedure is done through small incisions using a long thin tube (catheter). The catheter is used to deliver the new valve to your heart. A transcatheter valve is made of animal tissue and metal. It is used only for transcatheter valve replacement. If you have this type of replacement, you will likely need to take aspirin to prevent blood clots. Other blood thinning medications may also be used for a period of time.\n\nWhy TAVR?\nTAVR is an alternative to traditional open heart surgery to replace an aortic valve. TAVR was initially offered to patients with a higher risk for traditional surgery, such as:\n- Advanced age\n- A weaker heart\n- A history of previous heart surgery or stroke\n- Chronic obstructive lung disease, coronary artery disease, kidney disease, or diabetes\n- Previous radiation treatment to the chest\n- Porcelain aorta, extensive calcium around the aorta that would make open heart surgery impossible or difficult\n- Frailty or physical disability that would make recovery from open heart surgery challenging\n\nTAVR has proven to be a safe method for implanting an artificial valve in patients at lower surgical risk, with data accumulating on the durability of valves implanted through TAVR. Talk to your doctor about which valve is right for you. Your surgeon will talk with you about the risks and possible complications of TAVR.",
	"Risks and Possible Complications": "TAVR is very effective in most people. However, all surgeries carry some risks and possible complications. Some common risks of TAVR include:\n- Bleeding or the need for a transfusion\n- Anemia (not enough red blood cells in the blood)\n- Blood clots\n- Infection\n- Collection of fluid around the heart or damage to the heart\n- Damage to the blood vessels\n- Failure of the new valve\n- Heart attack\n- Heart rhythm problems that may require a pacemaker\n- Kidney damage or failure\n- Stroke\n- Risks of anesthesia (including death)\n- In rare cases, the new heart valve moving out of position after it has been implanted\n- Leaking of blood in or around the new heart valve\n\nIn general, these are the same risks for open heart surgery, but with TAVR, these risks are at a much lower rate. You may have other risks, depending on your medical condition. Be sure to talk with your doctor if you have any concerns before the procedure. Facilities that offer TAVR have a structural heart coordinator that you can contact, too.",
	"Recovery After Your Heart Valve Procedure": "After surgery, nurses will monitor you closely. You should be out of bed the day of your surgery. Once home, care for yourself as directed. It may take some time before you can get back to your full routine.",
	"Call 911": "Call 911 for immediate care if you have:\n- Chest pain\n- Severe difficulty breathing\n- Signs of stroke, such as sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arms, or legs",
	"When to Call Your Healthcare Provider": "Seek immediate medical help if you have any of the following symptoms:\n- Bowel movement that is bright red or dark black\n- Chills or fever of 100°F (37.7°C) or higher\n- Dizziness or fainting\n- Redness, swelling, bleeding, warmth, or fluid draining at the incision site\n- Weight gain of more than 2 pounds in 24 hours or more than 5 pounds in 1 week\n- Swelling in your hands, feet, or ankles\n- Shortness of breath that doesn't get better when you rest\n- Pain that gets worse or doesn't go away\n- Fast or irregular pulse\n- Other signs or symptoms as indicated by your healthcare provider",
	"What Is Mitral Valve Regurgitation?": "The mitral valve is one of four valves in the heart. It sits between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The mitral valve usually prevents blood from flowing from the left ventricle back into the left atrium. But in mitral valve regurgitation, blood can leak back through the valve. This causes the heart to work harder to pump blood. And if the condition gets worse, blood may back up into the lungs. If not treated, mitral valve regurgitation can cause other heart problems, such as heart failure.",
	"What Is Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER)?": "TEER is a procedure to repair your mitral valve without replacing it. Unlike open heart surgery, TEER is a minimally invasive procedure. During the procedure, the surgeon attaches a small clip, about the size of a dime, to your mitral valve. This clip helps the valve close properly and improves blood flow.",
	"How Is the Procedure Done?": "Your doctor will place the clip by inserting a long tube (catheter) into a vein near your groin. Then the surgeon will pass the tube into your heart and attach the clip to your mitral valve. In most cases, the procedure takes only a few hours.",
	"What Happens After the Procedure?": "Most people stay in the hospital overnight. You may stay for a few days. Follow all discharge instructions that your doctor gives you. Follow the Activity Guidelines for PTCA/Stent Patients on page 19 of this guide. Before having an MRI, tell your doctor that you have had TEER. You may be able to have some types of MRIs under certain conditions. Alert your doctor to any new symptoms.",
	"Life After TAVR/TEER": "Going forward, you'll need to take an active role in your care. This will help ensure you stay healthy. See your doctor for tests and follow-up visits. Guard your new heart valve against infection as directed. Also, be ready to make some changes to your lifestyle.",
	"Follow-Up Care": "Follow-up visits with your healthcare provider help make sure you're recovering well. In fact, to keep feeling your best, you'll need regular checkups for the rest of your life. During these visits, you may have:\n- Blood tests to monitor the function of your heart and kidneys, and check for anemia\n- Echocardiograms to check how well your heart and new heart valve are working\n- Electrocardiograms (ECGs) to show if your heart rhythm has changed after your valve replacement",
	"Staying Healthy After TAVR/TEER": "Take any prescribed blood thinners exactly as directed. Learn to take your own blood pressure and pulse. Keep a record of your results. Ask your healthcare provider which readings mean that you need medical care. Weigh yourself every day and keep a record of this. It is normal for your weight to fluctuate 2 to 3 pounds in a day; anything more than this could mean you are retaining fluid and developing heart failure. Tell all your healthcare providers and dentists you've had a valve replacement. Before any dental procedure, you will need to take an antibiotic to protect your new heart valve. Make lifestyle changes as advised by your healthcare provider. Keep in mind that healthy habits, such as exercise and a healthy diet, can strengthen your heart. Alert your healthcare provider to any new symptoms.",
	"Taking Medications": "Like many people with heart disease, you take a few types of medications. Some reduce the chance of heart attack and stroke. Others control risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol. You may also take medications for other heart problems, such as heart failure or an arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm). And other health conditions, such as diabetes, likely require medication, too. Keeping track of your medications and knowing what each does can get confusing. This chapter helps you understand the medications you're taking and teaches you skills for using them correctly and safely.",
	"Medications You May Also Take": "Anti-arrhythmic: helps slow and regulate a fast or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia).\nAnticoagulant: helps reduce the risk that a blood clot will form and block the artery.\nAntihypertensive: helps treat high blood pressure (hypertension).\nCalcium channel blocker: helps blood flow more easily through the arteries.",
	"Nitroglycerin Therapy": "Nitroglycerin widens blood vessels, increasing blood flow. It is prescribed to relieve the discomfort of angina. Taken daily, long-acting nitroglycerin may help prevent bouts of angina. Fast-acting nitroglycerin often can stop an angina attack. If it does not relieve your symptoms within 5 minutes, seek medical help right away.",
	"Using Fast-Acting Nitroglycerin": "Fast-acting nitroglycerin comes in tablet or spray form. A dose is one spray or one tablet. The usual way to take it is described below. If your doctor has told you differently, then follow his or her instructions.\n- Sit down before you take your dose. The medication may make you feel dizzy.\n- Place a tablet under your tongue. Let the tablet dissolve completely. Don't swallow it. If you do, it won't work. If using a spray, spray once on or under your tongue.\n- Wait 5 minutes. If the angina goes away, rest awhile and return to your normal routine.\n- If your angina lasts longer than 5 minutes, or gets worse, call 911 immediately. Do not delay. You may be having a heart attack. (To learn more about heart attack symptoms, see page 8.)\n- After you call 911, take a second dose of nitroglycerin. Wait another 5 minutes. If the angina still does not go away, take a third dose. You can take up to 3 doses within 15 minutes.",
	"Other Information for Nitroglycerin": "Have your nitroglycerin handy at all times. Keep it at room temperature, tightly closed in the container it came in. Don't put other medications, cotton, or anything else in the container. Check the expiration date. Refill your prescription and discard any expired nitroglycerin. Talk to your doctor before using nitroglycerin if you are taking medications for erectile dysfunction.",
	"Aspirin and Your Heart": "Aspirin is often prescribed to help prevent a second heart attack. Use aspirin therapy only if so directed by your doctor. If you have certain health problems or take certain medications, daily use of aspirin may not be right for you. If you think you're having a heart attack, chewing an aspirin in addition to taking fast-acting nitroglycerin might be helpful. Ask your doctor about this ahead of time. Then you'll know what to do in an emergency.",
	"Know the Medications You're Taking": "You should know certain details about your medications. This helps you take them correctly and safely. For each medication, ask your doctor or pharmacist the questions below. Write down the answers so you don't forget. Then fill in the information on your medication list. Also, ask about anything you don't understand or that seems wrong. For instance, if you get a refill and the pills don't look like the ones from last time, talk to the pharmacist before taking them.",
	"Questions to Ask": "What is the medication's name? Find out the brand name as well as the generic name, if any. Why am I taking this? What does it do? How often should I take this? At what time of day? How much of the medication (what dosage) should I take? What should I do if I miss a dose? Should I expect any side effects from this medication? What should I do if I have them? Do I follow any special instructions while taking this? Are there any activities, foods, or other medications I should avoid while taking this? How long should I keep taking this? When I run out, should I order more?",
	"Beware of Medication Interactions": "Vitamins, herbal supplements, and some over-the-counter drugs can be dangerous to take if you use heart medications. So tell your doctor about all the products you're taking. This includes even simple remedies for headaches, allergies, colds, or constipation. Show your medication list to the pharmacist every time you buy over-the-counter or prescription medication. They can tell you which drugs to avoid. Also, drinking alcohol while taking heart medication can be dangerous.",
	"Tips for Taking Medications": "It's easy to forget to take your medication, especially when you take a lot of pills. But to get the best results from medications, always use them as directed. The tips on these pages can help you keep track.",
	"Staying on Schedule": "Every medication has a different purpose. So, each one needs to be taken as prescribed. Don't skip pills or stop taking a medication, even when you feel fine. To stay on track, try to:\n- Take your medication at set times. You could take it each morning with breakfast, or right before you go to bed. Some medications may need to be taken at certain times of day or with food. Ask your doctor if this is true for any of yours.\n- Find ways to remind yourself to take medication. Use a pillbox to organize pills for the week. Set your watch alarm to go off when you're supposed to take your medication. Or put a note on the bathroom mirror to remind yourself.\n- Have your prescriptions refilled while you still have plenty of pills left. Keep in mind that certain suppliers, such as mail order pharmacies, may take longer to fill prescriptions.\n- When traveling, keep all medications in your carry-on bag. This way you'll have them in case you and your checked luggage get separated. Also, bring copies of each of your prescriptions when you travel.",
	"Safety Tips": "Read the warning labels and usage instructions for each medication you take. Also keep these safety tips in mind:\n- Get help organizing your pills if you need it. Taking more than one medication can be confusing. A family member or friend can help prevent you from making a mistake that could be dangerous to your health.\n- Fill all your prescriptions at the same drugstore. This way, your records are all in one place.\n- Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a 'fact sheet' or other patient information when you start a new medication.\n- Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you have allergies to any medication.\n- Don't split your pills to save money. Talk to your doctor if you're having trouble paying for your medications.\n- Never share medications with anyone.\n- Ask your pharmacy how you should dispose of old or expired medications.\n- Give a copy of your medication list to a family member or close friend. Hold copies of each other's lists in case of emergency.\n- Store medications in a cool, dry, dark place—not in a steamy bathroom.",
	"If You Have Side Effects": "Some medications can cause side effects, such as nausea or dizziness. Tell your doctor if you have any side effects. He or she may change the medication, dosage, or schedule to reduce effects. Be sure to keep taking your medication as directed, and always talk to your healthcare team about how you feel. Your feedback will help the doctor find the best medication plan for you.",
	"Healthy Eating": "By eating healthy foods more often, you'll take a big step toward better health. That's because most heart disease risk factors are linked to what and how much you eat. Eating healthier will help you improve cholesterol and blood pressure levels. It can also help you lose extra pounds or maintain a healthy weight. And if you have diabetes, healthy eating can help you manage it. This chapter guides you in making heart-healthy changes to your diet—without giving up all the foods or flavors you love.",
	"Choose to Eat Healthier": "Eating for heart health doesn't mean carrot sticks and chicken breasts are the only foods you can have. Instead, you can choose a variety of foods. Just eat more of the healthier ones, and ease up on less-healthy snacks. How much you put on your plate is also part of healthier eating. Cutting down on portion sizes will help you manage your weight.",
	"Eat More...": "Set a goal to add more of these types of foods to your diet:\n- Fresh fruits and vegetables. These have many health benefits. Most Americans don't eat enough.\n- Whole grains, such as whole-wheat bread and brown rice. These are high in fiber and rich in vitamins.\n- Foods high in unsaturated fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and fish. In moderate amounts, this type of fat is good for your heart.\n- Lean sources of protein. Beans and soy products supply your body with the protein it needs, just as lean cuts of meat do.",
	"Have Less...": "To improve your heart health, cut back on these types of foods:\n- High-fat animal products, such as fatty cuts of meat, butter, whole-fat milk and dairy products, and cream sauces. These raise LDL ('bad') cholesterol.\n- Snack foods and fast food. These often contain trans fat. This is the worst type of fat for your heart.\n- Foods high in sodium (salt). This is extra important if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.\n- Alcohol, if you have high blood pressure. Your doctor or cardiac rehab team can give you specific guidelines to follow.",
	"What About Calories?": "A calorie is a unit of energy. You get calories from the foods you eat. Your body burns some calories to fuel its functions. More calories are burned during activity. But if you eat more calories than your body burns, the extras are stored as fat. Tracking how many calories you eat helps you maintain a healthy weight. Your doctor, cardiac rehab team, and a dietitian can help you set up a diet and exercise program to meet your needs. If you're trying to lose weight, your calorie needs may be different from those on standard charts.",
	"Get Back to Basics": "Fresh foods are the best bet for taste and texture. All foods have calories, but fresh foods also hold a lot of nutrients. To get back to basics:\n- Stay away from foods with added fat, sugar, colors, or sodium. These foods tend to be high in calories and low in nutrients.\n- Compare labels to find foods high in fiber, vitamins, and other nutrients. Labels can also help you stay away from foods high in fat and sodium.\n- Put processed foods back on the shelf. Do you buy boxed pasta meals, instant noodles, or rice with powdered flavor packets? If so, cook regular pasta or rice seasoned with fresh herbs, instead. Even better, use whole grains!",
	"Keep Portions Reasonable": "How much you eat is almost as important as what you eat. Most Americans eat too much. To reduce portion sizes, try eating dinner off of a smaller plate. And to make the best use of your plate, follow the MyPlate model. As a goal, fill half your plate with vegetables and fruit. Split the other half between whole grains and protein. And pick low-fat or fat-free milk and dairy products.",
	"Using MyPlate": "MyPlate is a visual guide that can help you choose the best types and right amounts of foods to eat. Serving suggestions in this workbook are based on MyPlate's guidelines for a daily intake of 2,000 calories. Your needs may vary depending on your gender, age, and activity level. Visit www.ChooseMyPlate.gov to find guidelines more specific to you.",
	"Heart-Healthy Shopping": "Healthy eating starts at the store. Pay attention to food labels and make healthy choices as you shop. Doing so ensures you'll have healthy foods on hand at home when it's time to eat. The tips on these pages will help you get started.",
	"Get the Facts": "Reading Nutrition Facts labels is easy once you know how. Look for the words highlighted below.\n- Serving size is the basis for all values on the label. If you eat more than 1 serving, all other values on the label increase, too.\n- Calories from fat should be less than a third of the total calories. The closer this number is to the total calories, the more fat the food contains.\n- Total fat is the total amount of all types of fats per serving.\n- Saturated fat raises cholesterol levels and leads to clogged arteries. Look for foods with little or no saturated fat.\n- Trans fat is even worse for your heart than saturated fat. Look for foods with no trans fat.\n- Cholesterol can raise your levels of LDL ('bad') cholesterol. Even if this number is low, the food may not be good for you. Also look at the types and amounts of fats.\n- Sodium should be limited to 1,500 mg or less each day unless told otherwise by your doctor.\n- Dietary fiber aids digestion and helps control cholesterol. Try to get 14 g of fiber for every 1,000 calories you eat.",
	"Be a Heart-Smart Shopper": "Most people shop by habit. Now's the time to turn off the automatic pilot! Make a shopping list before you enter the store. Then stick to the list and avoid impulse buys. The following tips can help you make heart-healthy choices while you shop.\n- Produce section: Start shopping here. You can trim fat by building meals around produce instead of meat. And fresh fruits and vegetables contain almost no sodium!\n- Meat counter: Try fish or chicken instead of red meat. Remember: Beans, tofu, or nuts are also good alternatives to meat. Avoid meats that are cured or smoked. These processes add a lot of sodium.\n- Dairy section: Try lower-fat dairy products. If you usually buy whole milk, try reduced-fat or 1% instead.\n- Snack food section: Look for low-fat, low-sodium versions of your favorite snacks. Snack foods often contain trans fat, so read labels with care.\n- Frozen food section: Frozen dinners are often high in fat and sodium. Look for plain frozen foods without sauces.",
	"Healthy Eating at Home": "Healthy cooking starts with cutting down on the fat and salt you add to foods. This doesn't mean you have to sacrifice flavor or spend more time in the kitchen. There are lots of quick, easy ways to cook without using fat and salt. A cookbook with low-fat, low-sodium recipes can help. So can the tips below.",
	"Swap Out Some Ingredients": "Replace whole milk or cream in soups and sauces with low-fat milk. Replace half the fat called for in baked goods with applesauce. Use 2 egg whites or ¼ cup egg substitute in place of 1 whole egg. Use reduced-fat or skim-milk cheese in place of full-fat cheese. Replace standard spreads, such as margarine and mayonnaise, with types that include plant stanol and sterol esters.",
	"Sharpen New Cooking Skills": "Remove skin from chicken and turkey. Trim all visible fat from meat before cooking. Broil, bake, stew, poach, or microwave fish, chicken, turkey, and red meat. Brown meat under the broiler. Roast on a rack so the fat drips away. Simmer in low-sodium broth or wine instead of frying in fat. Use nonstick pans or nonstick cooking spray. Steam or microwave vegetables without adding fat or salt. Chill soups and stews. Then skim off any fat before reheating and serving.",
	"Add Flavor Without Fat or Salt": "Try herb blends, lemon juice, pepper, or flavored vinegar on vegetables. Add chopped onions, garlic, and peppers to flavor beans and rice. Sprinkle herbs on fish, chicken, turkey, and meat, and in soups. Marinate fish, chicken, turkey, and meat for flavor. Try ginger, lemon juice, low-sodium salsa, or a little wine. Spoon natural cooking juices over meat in place of gravy or cream sauce.",
	"Healthy Eating Out": "When you eat out, scan the menu for healthy choices. Restaurants often will make a dish in a healthier way. Ask for your order to be cooked without cheese, with no added salt, or with sauce on the side. Sometimes you can even get a meatless version of an item on the menu. The cook may not be able to meet every request, but most will help when they can. For a head start on healthy ordering, try the tips on this page.",
	"American Food": "Order grilled chicken or fish (without breading) instead of fried. Have a salad or baked potato instead of fries. At the salad bar, stick with fresh vegetables. Use oil and vinegar dressing. Keep in mind that low-fat dressings and canned and pickled items are often high in salt. Try a veggie burger instead of a hamburger.",
	"Italian Food": "Order pasta with marinara sauce. Don't add Parmesan cheese to pasta. Ask for pizza to be made with half the usual amount of cheese. Or check the menu for varieties without cheese. Order pasta or pizza with broccoli, spinach, and mushrooms, instead of salty, fatty meats such as sausage and pepperoni. Avoid dishes with a lot of cheese or cheese sauce.",
	"Asian Food": "Steamed dishes are often lowest in fat and sodium. Order steamed fish instead of fried. Have fish, chicken, or tofu. Order a vegetable dish instead of a meat dish. Dip food into sauce instead of pouring sauce on top.",
	"Mexican Food": "Fajitas are a good choice because you add your own fillings. Have them with vegetables, chicken, chili peppers, and only a pinch of cheese. Eat soft flour or corn tortillas instead of chips, and go light on the sour cream. Or have guacamole instead—it's made from avocados, which contain a good kind of fat (monounsaturated fat). Choose black beans over refried.",
	"Fast Food": "Fast food is very high in fat and salt. Eat at fast food restaurants only once in a while, if at all. If you do have fast food now and then, choose healthier items. Most fast food restaurants have a nutrition list of the foods they serve. This can help you order. Ask for this list at the counter. It may also be on the restaurant's website.",
	"Setting Goals for Healthier Eating": "The tips in the chapter you just read can help you eat healthier. But you don't need to make all the changes suggested all at once. Start by breaking a big goal into realistic, smaller steps. Here's how specific steps can add up to big success.",
	"Goal: Cut Sodium Intake": "Start by leaving salt out of your food. Use the tips on page 69 for cooking without sodium. When you're comfortable with these changes, move on to step 2. Cut back on high-sodium foods. Use food labels to see which of the packaged foods you often eat are highest in sodium. Phase these out of your meals. Track your progress. At least once a week, add up all the sodium you eat in a day. Compare these sodium logs to see how much your daily sodium intake goes down. When you're at your daily target sodium level, celebrate! Reward yourself for a job well done. Go to the movies or buy a special nonfood treat.",
	"Goal: Meet USDA Guidelines for Vegetables": "Start by choosing one new vegetable to try this week. Or fix an old favorite in a new, healthy way. Variety can keep you interested in eating more healthy foods. Have at least a serving of one vegetable each day with lunch. Eat a green salad with your sandwich instead of chips. Order vegetable soup and a whole-grain roll. Or pile fresh vegetables on a baked potato. Track your progress. Add up the servings of vegetables you eat daily. Mark a calendar each day you eat 2½ cups of vegetables. When you meet the guideline of 2½ cups daily for one week, celebrate! Watch a ball game or chat with an old friend.",
	"Exercising More": "Exercise is the most important part of cardiac rehab. It helps you get into better shape so your heart doesn't have to work as hard. Exercise also helps you control risk factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and weight. And it sets you up for a healthier future. For lasting results, exercise needs to be a lifelong commitment. You'll get started with a program in cardiac rehab. But when the program ends, it's up to you to keep going. The skills you learn in cardiac rehab will benefit you for the rest of your life—if you keep them up!",
	"Get Moving!": "Walking is the easiest way to exercise. It's an aerobic exercise that's good for your heart. And it requires nothing more than a pair of sneakers and your own two feet! Work toward a goal of at least 40 minutes of exercise, 3 to 4 days a week. Taking daily walks will help you meet this goal.",
	"Ease In and Out of Exercise": "Break each walking session into phases: Stroll, Stride, Stroll, Stretch. Gradually work up to the pace your cardiac rehab team suggests. Then ease back down. These are good guidelines for other forms of aerobic exercise, too. Start walking slowly. Take 5 minutes to work up to full stride. Warming up like this loosens muscles and increases your heart rate little by little. At first, walk briskly for 1 or 2 minutes. Build up to 5 minutes, then 10. Gradually increase the amount of time you walk until you work up to at least 40 minutes. A moderate pace is all you need. Spend 5 minutes slowing back down. This lowers your heart rate and blood pressure gently, keeping you from feeling lightheaded. This is especially important if you take certain blood pressure medications. Finish by gently stretching your legs and arms. Stretch for 5 minutes. Don't jerk or bounce. Hold each stretch a few seconds. Breathe normally. If a stretch hurts, ease up.",
	"Add Activity to Your Day": "In addition to scheduled workouts, try to be more active overall. A few easy ways to increase daily movement are listed below:\n- Take the stairs at your apartment or job, instead of the elevator.\n- Park your car a little farther from stores.\n- Play with your kids or grandkids more often.\n- Walk your dog around the block a few extra times.\n- Take a lap around the market or mall before you start shopping.\n- Visit a zoo, museum, or park.\n- Take a short walk at lunch.\n- Walk to see a co-worker or a neighbor instead of phoning.",
	"Make Every Step Count": "Wearable fitness devices and smartphone apps provide an easy way to track how many steps you take each day. If you don't have one of these devices, you can also use a pedometer, which is a small step-tracking device that you can clip to your belt. Use these devices to set small goals for yourself. For instance, if you walk 4,000 steps daily, try adding 200 more steps each day. Aim for a goal of 7,500. Work with your healthcare provider to set goals that are right for you.",
	"Managing Your Risk Factors": "This chapter tells you which factors increase the risk of future heart problems. While every topic in this chapter may not apply to your situation, you will benefit by knowing more about cholesterol and blood pressure. Along with managing your specific risk factors, you also need to keep eating well, exercising, and taking your medications as directed.",
	"What Are Your Risk Factors?": "A risk factor increases your chance of having heart disease. Some risk factors can't be controlled, such as age and a family history of heart disease. But most others can be managed by making lifestyle changes and taking medications. For each risk factor you reduce, your chance of heart attack and stroke goes down. And the length and quality of your life may go up.",
	"Risks You Can Manage": "The risk factors on these pages can all be changed. Check off your risk factors below.",
	"Abnormal Cholesterol Levels": "Abnormal cholesterol levels make plaque more likely to build up in the arteries. You're at risk if you have:\n- Total cholesterol higher than 200 mg/dL\n- LDL ('bad') cholesterol 100 mg/dL or higher; or above 70 mg/dL, if indicated by your doctor\n- HDL ('good') cholesterol lower than 40 mg/dL (men) or 50 mg/dL (women)\n- Triglycerides higher than 150 mg/dL",
	"High Blood Pressure": "High blood pressure (hypertension) occurs when blood pushes too hard against artery walls as it flows through these vessels. This damages the artery lining. In general, you're at risk if you have:\n- Blood pressure of 120/80 or higher. Your doctor may prescribe a personal goal.\n- Blood pressure of 140/90 or higher is hypertension.",
	"Smoking": "This is the most important risk factor you can change. Smoking damages arteries and makes it easier for plaque to build up. Smokers are also at higher risk of blood clots (which can block arteries) and stroke. You're at risk if you smoke cigarettes, cigars, or a pipe.",
	"Diabetes": "This health problem leads to a high level of sugar in your blood. It can damage the arteries if not kept under control. Diabetes makes you more likely to have a silent heart attack (one without symptoms). You're at risk if your A1C is higher than 7% or your eAG is above 154.",
	"Excess Weight": "Being overweight makes other risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, more likely. Excess weight around the waist or stomach increases your heart disease risk the most. You're at risk if your waist circumference is 35 inches or more (women) or 40 inches or more (men).",
	"Lack of Physical Activity": "If you're not active, problems with diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight are more likely. You're at risk if you exercise less than 30 minutes per day, fewer than 5 days a week.",
	"Stress and Strong Emotions": "Stressful events and feelings can raise heart rate and blood pressure. Stress can also bring on feelings of depression, anxiety, and anger. These feelings do not directly lead to heart disease, but they do affect overall health and make quality of life worse.",
	"What Is Metabolic Syndrome?": "A grouping of risk factors called metabolic syndrome increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Some physicians consider metabolic syndrome a precursor to heart disease. Talk with your doctor if you have three or more of these:\n- Waist circumference of more than 35 inches (women) or 40 inches (men)\n- HDL cholesterol lower than 40 mg/dL (men) or 50 mg/dL (women)\n- Triglycerides above 150 mg/dL\n- Blood pressure of 130/85 or higher\n- Blood sugar A1C of 7% or above, or an eAG of 154 or higher",
	"Understanding Cholesterol": "Cholesterol is a type of fat (lipid) that's carried in the blood. The body needs some cholesterol to stay healthy. But when cholesterol levels are abnormal, your risk of heart attack is increased. You can limit the amount of cholesterol entering your body in food by changing what you eat. For added control, your doctor may also prescribe medications. Regular testing can show how well your cholesterol levels are responding to treatment.",
	"Types of Lipids": "Each type of lipid affects the body in different ways. To function normally, the body needs the right balance of these types.\n- LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is often called 'bad' cholesterol. When the body has too much LDL, it can build up in artery walls. This can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Ideally, LDL should be lower than 70 after a heart attack or surgery.\n- Triglycerides are another type of lipid often measured with cholesterol. A high triglyceride level may lead to plaque buildup in arteries. Triglyceride level should be lower than 150.\n- HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is known as 'good' cholesterol. That's because it picks up leftover LDL cholesterol from the arteries and carries it back to the liver to be used again. HDL should be 55 or higher for men; 65 or higher for women.\n- Total cholesterol is the combined measure of all types of cholesterol. This number should be under 200.",
	"Understanding Blood Pressure": "As the heart pumps blood through the body, force is created inside the arteries. Blood pressure is the measure of this force. When blood pressure is high, the heart must pump harder to push blood through the arteries. Over time, this extra work can weaken the heart and damage blood vessels. High blood pressure can be managed with exercise, changes in diet, and the use of medications. Measuring blood pressure can show how well a treatment plan is working.",
	"Measuring Blood Pressure": "Blood pressure can be measured by a healthcare provider or you can do it at home. The test always gives two numbers: a systolic pressure 'over' a diastolic pressure (for example, '120 over 80').\n- Systolic pressure is the first, or 'top,' number. It measures the pressure when your heart beats (contracts) and blood flow is strongest. Normal systolic pressure is less than 120.\n- Diastolic pressure is the second, or 'bottom,' number. It measures pressure in the arteries when the heart relaxes between beats. Normal diastolic pressure is less than 80.",
	"To Measure Blood Pressure at Home": "Put on the blood pressure cuff, following the directions that came with the device. Sit comfortably with your arm supported on a table. Rest quietly for 5 minutes. Start the blood pressure device. Wait while your blood pressure is measured. If the reading is very different from usual, wait 5 minutes. Then try again. Ask your healthcare provider ahead of time what to do if this reading is very high or very low. Take your blood pressure in the morning and in the evening to see how it varies.",
	"If You Have Diabetes": "With diabetes, your body has trouble using a sugar called glucose for energy. As a result, the sugar level in your blood becomes too high. Left untreated, high blood sugar can damage arteries. Diabetes also makes other problems, such as high blood pressure and abnormal cholesterol, more dangerous. To maintain heart health as well as good diabetes control, focus on managing your blood sugar level. Healthy eating and daily exercise will help. But there are other things you need to do, too. These include regular blood sugar testing, meal planning, and taking any prescribed medications.",
	"Blood Sugar Testing": "Testing your blood sugar each day helps you make wiser food choices. If you use insulin, test results will also show if your medication needs to be adjusted to bring your blood sugar level back into target range. You may be asked to check blood sugar both before and after meals. Record the times of your readings in a log. This will help you spot trends, such as high blood sugar after eating certain foods. The hemoglobin A1C blood test can show your blood sugar levels over time. It's also called the glycated hemoglobin test. This test measures your average blood sugar level over the past few months. A higher A1C result means your blood sugar has been high. This means that you may have a higher risk of complications from diabetes. When you have high blood sugar, much more glucose sticks to the red blood cells. This is what the A1C test measures.",
	"Learn How Carbs Affect Blood Sugar": "To get energy that lasts a while, your body needs food that contains carbohydrates. But carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels higher and faster than other kinds of food. That's why you may need to limit the amount of carbohydrates you eat at one time. The three types of carbohydrates to be aware of are listed below:\n- Starches raise your blood sugar. Starchy vegetables include potatoes, peas, corn, and lima beans. Starches are also found in grains, kidney and pinto beans, and lentils.\n- Sugars raise your blood sugar level quickly. Foods with natural sugars include fruits, dairy products, and honey. Added sugars are found in many desserts, candy, soda, and juices. Alcohol may contain both natural and added sugars.\n- Fiber delays absorption of sugar, so it helps control blood sugar level. Fiber is found in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, and nuts.",
	"Timing Your Meals": "For blood sugar control, when you eat is as important as what you eat. You may need to eat several small meals spaced evenly throughout the day to stay in your target range. So don't skip breakfast or wait until late in the day to get most of your calories. Doing so can cause your blood sugar to rise too high or fall too low.",
	"Medications for Diabetes": "To help control your diabetes, you may take medication. This is in addition to medication you take for your heart. Diabetes medications may be taken in the following ways:\n- Oral medications help the body make insulin or help it use insulin better. Add the names of any medications you take for diabetes to your medication list.\n- Injectable hormones can increase the body's production of insulin, or slow the release of glucose into the bloodstream.\n- Prescribed insulin provides the insulin your body needs but cannot make. Insulin is typically injected into the body.",
	"Smoking: This Time, Quit for Good": "If you smoke, quitting is one of the most important changes you can make for your heart. Your risk of heart attack will go down within one day of putting out that last cigarette. As you go longer without smoking, your risk will go down even more. Quitting smoking isn't easy, but millions of people have done it. You can, too! The information on these pages can help. If you've already quit, these pages can help you stay on track.",
	"Have a 'Quit Plan'": "Quitting takes patience and a plan. You'll boost your chances of success by deciding on your 'quit plan' ahead of time. Plan when you'll quit, how you'll deal with urges to smoke, and who you'll ask to support you. Your doctor and cardiac rehab team can work with you to develop this plan. Even if you've already quit, it's easy to slip back into smoking. Have a plan to help you stay off cigarettes for good.",
	"Track Your Triggers": "Do certain emotions trigger your urge to smoke? How about certain people or places? Knowing the situations that make you want to smoke can help you avoid them in the future. For one day, write down every instance you have the urge to smoke. Record the time of day and what you were doing just before you had the urge. Do you see any patterns? Think about ways you can avoid or deal with these triggers.",
	"Choose a Quit-Smoking Product to Help": "Using a quit-smoking product makes you much more likely to quit for good. Some products can be bought over the counter. Others require a prescription. Talk to your healthcare provider or cardiac rehab team about these products. They can help you make a decision about which to try. (Note: These products contain nicotine. Don't smoke while using a nicotine product. Doing so could give you a dangerous overdose of nicotine.)",
	"Smoking: Working Through Withdrawal": "You'll likely go through a short period of withdrawal as your body adjusts to not having cigarettes. This will pass. Talk to your cardiac rehab team and others in your program about what you're going through. The tips on these pages can help you manage the first weeks without smoking.",
	"Be Prepared": "Nicotine is a powerful and addictive drug. Since your body is used to the effects of nicotine, not smoking can bring on withdrawal. This can cause symptoms such as mood swings, lower energy, and trouble thinking clearly. Don't worry. These symptoms will go away. Medications can help ease the symptoms of withdrawal.",
	"Keep Yourself Busy": "Being active is a great way to distract yourself when you get the urge to smoke. A little activity makes you less likely to want a cigarette. It's also good for you! Here are some things you can try when the urge strikes:\n- Garden for a few minutes.\n- Play a game with your kids or grandkids.\n- Walk around the block.\n- Stretch your arms and shoulders.\n- Drink a glass of water.\n- Brush your teeth.\n- Take a few deep breaths of fresh air outside.\n- Exercise.",
	"Learn from Slip-Ups": "What if you slip up and have a cigarette? A slip doesn't mean you've failed. Look at it as a chance to learn. What were you doing when you smoked? Were you with a smoker? Were you lonely? If you find the reason for your slip, you can make a plan for how to deal with it. Then get right back on track. Any time you slip into smoking again, take control and put the cigarette out. If you tried to quit before and didn't succeed, don't doubt yourself this time. Use what you've learned to stay on track.",
	"Get Lots of Support": "Support from others can help you stay quit. Ask a friend if you can call and talk when you get the urge to smoke. Ask friends and family members not to smoke around you or keep cigarettes in the house. Simply being around people when they're smoking puts your health at risk. Ask a friend or family member who smokes to quit with you. Also, find out if others in your cardiac rehab group are trying to quit. You can learn from each other.",
	"Your Emotional Health": "When you have heart disease, your emotional health is as important as your physical health. Research has shown that emotional well-being leads to longer, healthier lives for people with heart disease. This chapter covers the most common emotional concerns of people who are dealing with heart disease. If you're having trouble in any of these areas, be sure to talk to your healthcare provider or cardiac rehab team. They'll probably be able to help, or at least point you in the right direction.",
	"Overcoming Depression": "Depression is a treatable problem that's very common among people with heart disease. It's natural for you to feel overwhelmed or down after a heart attack or heart surgery. You may even feel angry or sad about having to make lifestyle changes. Some medications can cause depression as well. It's normal to have these feelings some of the time. But if they start to take over your life, it's a sign of a bigger problem. Talk to your doctor if this could be true for you.",
	"Are You Depressed?": "Depression can make you feel unhappy, down, or sad every day. You may lose interest in hobbies, activities, and people you used to enjoy. Depression may also cause you to:\n- Feel worthless, guilty, or helpless much of the time\n- Feel hopeless about the future\n- Have trouble sleeping, or sleep more than usual\n- Not feel like eating, or eat too much\n- Feel tired, weak, or low in energy\n- Have trouble concentrating, remembering, or making decisions\n- Withdraw from family and friends",
	"What You Can Do": "You can become more involved in the world around you. Try doing the following:\n- Keep doing things you enjoy. Schedule times for hobbies, old and new. Maybe a weekly game of dominoes or cards with friends? Or you can join religious groups or senior centers.\n- Try something new. Is there an activity you've always been interested in but have never tried? There's no time like right now! Look into classes or community groups that focus on your area of interest.\n- Stay involved. Family and friends can be good sources of support. If you don't want to discuss your health, talk about other things.\n- Join a heart disease support group. Talking with people who know firsthand what you're going through may help.",
	"Staying Involved in Life": "You've gone through a life-altering event. Whether it's a diagnosis, a heart attack, or major surgery, your life has changed. This may cause you to withdraw from family, friends, and the outside world. But by staying involved with life, your chance of a heart attack goes down.",
	"Who Will Support You?": "Think about the questions below. Each yes answer represents a person who could be a source of support. Who comes to mind? Talk with those people when you're feeling alone. People who care about you truly want to help. If you feel like you have no one to talk to, call your doctor. He or she will help you find a source of support.\n- Is there someone who will listen when you need to talk?\n- Can you count on anybody to give you advice when you need it?\n- Is there a person you can share affection with?",
	"Dealing with Stress": "How you react to life's ups and downs can make a difference in your health. Managing heart disease can be a source of stress. But learning to deal with that stress can bring peace of mind. It's also a good reminder of what's important in your life. You can't get rid of all stress. But you can choose how to respond.",
	"Keys to Managing Stress": "Being aware of yourself and the choices you make is the first step in dealing with stress. Keep these simple ideas in mind:\n- Identify your stressors. Sources of stress are unique for each person. What causes your stress? Knowing these triggers can help you focus on things you want to change.\n- Have realistic expectations. Life is full of unexpected events. And even things you plan often won't turn out exactly as you'd hope. If your expectations aren't met, do you have to feel bad? Can you be flexible?\n- Change your response to stress. Even if you can't change a stressful situation, you can control how you respond to it. You're the one in charge of your thoughts and actions. This simple idea is your most powerful tool in dealing with stress.\n- There is help. If you would like to talk with a professional about depression, anger, or hostility, consider speaking with a psychologist.",
	"Take Time to Relax": "Stress can make you feel sick, worried, or anxious. It can even harm your heart by increasing heart rate and raising blood pressure. To help reduce stress, make an effort to relax your body and your mind. Set aside some time each day to relax. Make this time just for you. Listen to soft music or relaxation tapes. Some activities can help you unwind, too. You could try yoga or tai chi. Meditate, pray, or read a good book.",
	"Sex and Intimacy": "When people have heart trouble, they often develop strong feelings that can affect their desire for sex. You may be afraid for the future. You may even feel angry that this has happened to you. But as your body heals, your interest and desire for sex are likely to return. When you and your partner are ready, there's no reason you can't renew your sexual relationship. Start gradually. And try not to worry about your heart. Sex only takes about as much energy as climbing two flights of stairs.",
	"To Rebuild Intimacy": "An intimate relationship is built on sharing feelings. The stress and worry of a heart attack or surgery can upset this closeness. It can even cause sexual problems that weren't there before. Talking honestly with your partner is the first step toward rebuilding intimacy. It may be difficult for you to talk about your feelings. But keeping your feelings to yourself may make you and your partner feel alone.",
	"Resuming Sexual Intimacy": "Having sex is only one part of being intimate. So don't push yourself into having sex before you're ready. Try hugging, kissing, and touching at first. This can help you feel close again. When you're ready for sex, focus on pleasing each other.",
	"Notes for Family and Friends": "Being close to someone with heart disease is likely to bring some changes in your own life. You may be called upon to serve as a helper, caregiver, or source of support. Be sure to take care of yourself, too!",
	"Coping with Heart Disease": "Many aspects of your loved one's health are out of your control. You can offer help and support, but you can't make heart disease go away. Despite this, you do have a role to play. Learn about heart disease and your loved one's health. This will help you know what you can do to help. Go to a cardiac rehab session with your loved one. This way you can see firsthand what he or she is learning to do. It will also give you a chance to ask the staff questions. Be supportive, but try not to be controlling. Don't nag or assume you know best. Instead, ask your loved one to talk about what he or she needs and how you can help. Learn the signs of a heart attack or stroke, and watch for them. You may also want to take a class in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).",
	"Making Lifestyle Changes": "Much of your loved one's treatment revolves around making changes. Believe in your loved one's ability to change. Saying 'I know you can do it' goes a long way. When possible, make the same changes yourself. Your heart will thank you for it! If you prepare meals for the family, make them heart-healthy. Go food shopping together. Help your loved one read labels and select healthy foods. Exercise together, perhaps by taking walks around the neighborhood. Exercise can be more enjoyable with another person along. If you smoke, quit! If you're not ready to quit, at least don't smoke in front of your loved one. Remember: Exposure to secondhand smoke is dangerous to your loved one's health. To help you and your loved one avoid the urge to smoke, do not keep cigarettes around the house.",
	"Appendix": "This chapter gives you information you can use to manage heart disease on a daily basis. Remember, the best way to protect your heart is to be active in your healthcare. Never be afraid to talk with your doctor, nurse, or other rehab team members. It may help to write down questions so you'll be sure to ask about everything you want to know.",

	"Glossary of Terms": "Angina: Symptoms that occur when the heart muscle can't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Angina often feels like pressure, tightness, or pain in the chest, arm, neck, shoulder, or jaw.\nAngiogram: A special X-ray of blood vessels to see the amount of blockage.\nAngioplasty: A procedure to unclog blocked arteries, using a thin tube (catheter) with a balloon that inflates to open the artery.\nArrhythmia: An abnormal (irregular) heart rhythm or rate.\nArtery: A blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body.\nAtherosclerosis: Buildup of plaque in arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart, brain, or parts of the body. It occurs when artery walls thicken and lose elasticity.\nCABG (pronounced 'cabbage'): Coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This surgery creates a new pathway for blood around narrowed arteries in the heart.\nCholesterol: A fatty substance that can build up within artery walls. Some is made by the body. Some enters the body through foods you eat. In people with heart disease, the level of cholesterol in the blood is often too high.\nCoronary arteries: The blood vessels that wrap around the heart. These supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.\nCoronary artery disease (CAD): A condition that occurs when the arteries that carry blood to the heart are narrowed. Also known as 'heart disease.'\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): A test that records the way electrical signals move through the heart.\nHDL cholesterol: 'Good' cholesterol that helps remove LDL ('bad') cholesterol and triglycerides from the blood. HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein.\nHeart disease: A disease in which damage to the heart or the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart keeps the heart from working properly.\nHeart failure: A condition that occurs when the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Heart failure can be a result of heart disease, heart attack, or uncontrolled high blood pressure.\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension): A disease in which blood pushes with too much force against artery walls as it moves through the arteries. This damages the arteries over time.\nInsulin: A hormone that controls blood sugar in the body. With diabetes, either the body doesn't make any insulin or it can't effectively use the insulin it does make.\nIschemia: Reduced blood supply to an organ or tissue, such as the heart or leg muscles. Ischemia in the heart can lead to angina. If it occurs in the leg muscles, claudication can occur.\nLDL cholesterol: 'Bad' cholesterol that can cause plaque to build up in artery walls. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein.\nLipids: Fats and fatty substances carried in the bloodstream. The body needs lipids for energy. But lipid levels that are too high raise the chance of heart attack and stroke.\nMetabolic syndrome: A health problem that occurs when a person has three or more of the following: low HDL cholesterol; high triglycerides; high blood pressure; high fasting blood sugar; extra weight around the waist. This syndrome puts you at extra high risk of heart disease.\nMyocardial infarction (MI): Another term for heart attack. This occurs when the blood supply to the heart is cut off, resulting in permanent damage to the heart muscle. (The myocardium is the thick middle layer of the heart muscle.)\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD): A type of vascular (blood vessel) disease that affects the arteries supplying blood to the legs.\nPlaque: Fatty deposits that build up inside the arteries and reduce blood flow.\nSaturated fat: A type of fat that raises blood cholesterol. It's mostly found in foods from animal sources, such as butter, lard, fatty cuts of beef, and high-fat dairy. This fat should be limited as much as possible because it's bad for your heart.\nSilent heart attack: A heart attack without any symptoms; ischemia without pain. Also called a 'silent MI' or 'silent ischemia.'\nStent: A tiny wire mesh tube inserted into a blocked artery to help keep it open.\nStroke: Occurs when blood flow is cut off by blockage or rupture in a blood vessel supplying the brain. Brain damage results.\nTrans fat: A type of fat found in french fries and other fast food, snack foods (such as chips and cookies), and some margarines and shortenings. This is the worst fat for your heart and should be avoided.\nTransient ischemic attack (TIA): A temporary blockage of blood supplying the brain, causing stroke-like symptoms.\nTriglycerides: A type of fat measured in the blood along with cholesterol. High triglyceride levels are a risk factor for heart attack and stroke.\nUnsaturated fat: The healthiest type of fat. It's found in some oils (such as olive, peanut, and canola), nuts, seeds, and fish. Unsaturated fat can be good for your heart in moderate amounts."
